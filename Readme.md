# timesheet automation for imperva
## my rant and reasoning  
pissed me off that i am paid globally and due to regulation i need to lie about doing less hours
so i made this little automation script so ill be able to lie about doing less hours more effectively 

if you work crazy hours like me and hate wasting time on regulation guided lies to the authorities 
please download this and have fun


## oh and i almost forgot, the usage 
Usage: ./timesheet.rb [options]
    -r, --[no-]refresh-session       refresh user session
